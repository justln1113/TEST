A recipe to build a statistical parametric singing voice synthesis system. The system consists of three trainable networks:

1. Time-lag model
2. Duration model
3. Acoustic model

The recipe structure is almost the same as [kiritan_singing/00-svs-world](../../kiritan_singing/00-svs-world). Please check the README of kiritan database for more details.
